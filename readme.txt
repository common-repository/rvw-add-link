Add links and menus to posts, pages, and custom post types.  

An "Add Link"  button is added to the editor, click to show a menu:

+	Posts, Pages, to select a link destination.
+	Custom link, to type in the url of an external page.
+	Menus, to insert a menu that has been created in the Appearance --> Menus page.

A label may be added to describe the link.

All links will be inserted in the post as a "shortcode"

Menus will be rendered by the WordPress wp_nav_menu() function, this adds classes to various parts of the menu to enable it to be styled using css [more details here.] (http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_nav_menu)
